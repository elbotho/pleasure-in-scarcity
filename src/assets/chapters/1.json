Then it disappears as the oven reaches its temperature, the air flow becomes audible, a roaring sounds from within the metal that gives the rocket stove its name. While the thermometer is rising in small increments, just barely climbing up the 200° mark, I get the dough ready.*</div>\n\nRarely has there been a moment in recent Western memory when we have become aware of the scarcity of things.
