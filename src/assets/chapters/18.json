Instead, the decisive factor to achieve change is “how” we approach it. The spirit in which to approach change matters most. A spirit of pleasure in change becomes a sustainable driver for action. Instead of being based on antagonism, it is based on love. When action becomes more than enforced behaviour but an attitude, when it is not rooted in reactionary behaviour but in proactive action and pleasure, then it becomes action in the spirit for change.</div>",
