  "content": "<div class=\"pleasure-text\">*Red faces, orange glimmer, up in the air and down here in our eyes, as the wood cracks and the flames dance in the soft breeze. It's a cold day, but the cold can't enter. We're standing there, staring and following the dance of fire, never boring, always surprising. These moments are rare, when thoughts slow down, when the work of the day fades away, a moment that stretches endlessly.*\n\n</div><div class=\"text\">Corona raised awareness for the reality of material scarcity. Creating a new normality, it forced a reevaluation of the perception of such scarcity. Instead of accepting inconvenience, it encouraged a change of behaviour embracing scarcity. By changing the attitude towards scarcity, Corona was in some parts able to create the spirit of pleasure in scarcity. In the following chapters, I propose a collective approach to change based on that spirit.</div>",
