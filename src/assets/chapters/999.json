The website content is accessible as long as the system is able to provide sufficient power.\n\nIt is expected to stay online during bad weather conditions for 30 hours. To reduce battery load it will be inaccessible after midnight. <br/><span style=\"color: #f00;\">During longer periods of bad weather, and between 0:00 and 7:00 CEST, this website will go offline.</span> Plan your visit accordingly and consider downloading this [file to read offline](/pdf/200504-daniel_parnitzke-finding_pleasure_in_scarcity-MA_thesis.pdf). Read about this solar website in the [appendix](/chapter/27) of this thesis.</div>",
