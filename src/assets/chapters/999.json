  "content": "<div class=\"\">This website is hosted on a server that is locally powered through an off-the-grid solar system with its own energy storage. It is expected to stay online during bad weather conditions for 30 hours. During longer periods of bad weather, this website will go offline. \n\nThe website content is accessible as long as the system is able to provide sufficient power. You can see the battery status displayed at the top left corner. If the battery charge is low, the website is about to go offline, making this text unavailable. In that case, please consider downloading this [file to read offline](/pdf/200504-daniel_parnitzke-finding_pleasure_in_scarcity-MA_thesis.pdf). Read more about this solar website in the [appendix](/chapter/27) of this thesis.</div>",
