It’s a cold day, but not around us. We’re standing there, following the choreography of flames, always new and surprising. These moments are rare, when thoughts slow down, when the work of the day fades away, a moment stretches endlessly.\n\n</div><div class=\"text\">The Corona-crisis raised awareness for the reality of material scarcity. Creating a ‘new normal’, it forced a reevaluation of its perception. Instead of accepting inconvenience, it encouraged a change of behaviour through embraced scarcity. By changing the attitude towards scarcity, Corona was in some parts able to create the spirit of pleasure in scarcity. In the following chapters, I propose a collective approach to change based on such a spirit.</div>",
