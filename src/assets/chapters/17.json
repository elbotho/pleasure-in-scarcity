  "content": "<div class=\"text\">All approaches discussed here represent ways in which humans try to cope with an omnipresent crisis, but which have not proven successful so far in enacting change. Mainly focussing on mechanics but not on the way how change is approached, they fail to create the needed spirit for change. Instead, they are protective strategies to cope with the immensity of the problem, rather than scenarios that let hope for real change. Rooted in painful sentiments of fear they result in unsustainable action by perpetuating inherent pain. As established earlier, fear is a bad motivation for action. Action based on fear is not sustainable, as it fails to transcend the painful sentiment it is based on. It can only sustain itself through perpetuated guilt, denial, flight or anger, thereby perpetuating problematic behaviour, creating a non-negotiable status quo of our current lifestyles. <br/>The main flaw in all existing approaches is that they rely on fear at their core. Instead, approaches for change need to find different driving forces for mobilisation, action and collectivity, that are based on constructive and positive sentiments, with pleasure at their core.</div>",
