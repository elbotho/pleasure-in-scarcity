  "content": "<div class=\"text\">The material research accompanying this theoretic work is based on the creation of functional objects from a materiality of scarcity in order to create a collective spirit through collective moments. Aiming for the production of pleasurable experiences, it is not intended to create a service-client dynamic but rather incorporates people voluntarily in the production of pleasure. Thereby pleasure emerges through collective moments of proactive creation.<br/>Being based on principles such as immediate combustion and assembled materiality with the inherent capacity to change, adapt and evolve, the objects are capable to harness attention, interest and participation. The pleasure of using them is related to mastering their constraints and figuring out their functionalities through a tacit learning process, for example by splitting wood or lighting a fire. \n\nThe objects become representations for a way of life, at the same time facilitating that way of life. They are based on accessible functionality and scarce materiality, applicable in various contexts to create wellbeing, becoming productive tools of pleasure e.g. by heating, cooking or manufacturing. Acting as centrepieces, the objects become distinctive anchors for participation and proactive collectivity. Like in the Kibbutz they gather community around themselves, and like the Shakers's furniture they become a representation of a way of life. </div>",
