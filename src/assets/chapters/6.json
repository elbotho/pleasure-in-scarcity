Such materiality can become representation of the spirit of a community, as can be seen for example with the Shaker furniture. The Shakers, a spiritual sect that formed communities in the 18th century United States, is governed by a communal lifestyle and largely self sufficient. Today, they are known especially for their innovation in technology and furniture making (\"Shakers\", 2020). A way of life emphasizing craftsmanship, the community responded to its emerging needs by making furniture and tools in the spirit of their way of life. This distinct furniture represents the values of Shaker lifestyle, for example the rejection of ornaments as deceitful. Objects were meant to be mountable to the walls for the time when they would not be in use. Today, the furniture became attributed to values that defined it, whereas in the first place the furniture was part of defining those values. While objects may become representations for a way of life, like in case of the Shakers, they may also enable it, or in the words of Marshall McLuhan: \"We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us\"(Culkin, 1967).</div>",
