  "content": "<div class=\"text\">In tribe-scale communities, collectivity emerges through a collective spirit based on a specific materiality. Such materiality can become representation of the spirit of a community. As an example, the Shakers, a spiritual sect that formed communities in the 18th century United States. Governed by a communal lifestyle and largely self sufficient, they are known today especially for their innovation in technology and furniture making. (WIKIPEDIA, Shakers). Living based on an emphasis of craftsmanship, the community responded to its emerging needs. The distinct furniture represents the values of Shaker lifestyle, for example the rejection of ornaments as deceitful. Objects were meant to be mountable to the walls for the time when they would not be in use. Therefore a wooden wall-peg was installed in many Shaker houses where objects and tools could be stored when not in use. Today, the furniture became attributed to values that defined it, whereas in the first place the furniture was part of defining those values. <br/>Tools and objects like in the case of the Shakers represent a way of life and its related needs. While objects may become representations for a way of life, they may also enable it, or in the words of Marshall McLuhan: \"We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us\"(QUOTE, Marshall McLuhan). <br/>When envisioning a community based on the spirit of pleasure in scarcity, its way of life will be based on a materiality of scarcity. In the next part is described, how the materiality of such a new way of life could look like.</div>",
