With the notion “no solutions please”, the intervention positions itself as an “anti-manual”, not claiming to have solutions for the right way to gather, but rather inviting the inventiveness of social dynamics while gathering. These kinds of dynamics that may happen around a fire, a beer, a game, etc., are the key to negotiate commonalities, ways of gathering, collective values or attitudes in a collective spirit. \nConstructLab identifies space that is not bound to a function as “convivial space”, allowing users to project their own ideas into that space. It is an invitation for users to participate in togetherness.\n\n</div><div class=\"pleasure-text\">*Pairs of eyes, soft conversation, nothing around us but fire and warmth. We forget what separates, no language is needed, what counts is to keep the fire burning. Search the flames, seek for wood, more wood, we need more wood. Again the flames rise higher, the heat with them, as faces shine bright in the setting sun.*\n\n</div><div class=\"text\">Togetherness doesn’t need a playbook but rather space and situations to emerge. The result of togetherness is also not foreseeable, but may lead to collective dynamics. “Under certain conditions, the gathering of individuals can lead to collaborative dynamics, productive ways of being together, transforming through action the urban and socio-political environment” (ConstructLab, 2019). Collectivity emerges through creating moments of shared pleasure, produced by dynamics of mutual care and procreation. Procreative participation creates authorship, thereby creates responsibility to upkeep and maintain. When people actively take part and create an experience together, this can lead to sustainable action.\n\nSuch action can already take place on a very small scale. According to Barnabé Chaillot who suggests the creation of tribe-scale communities, such small scale can lead to sustainable action. Promoting an autonomist lifestyle, he claims that a sustainable way of life needs to operate on the scale of the tribe. Chaillot defines the tribe as a manageable community connected within a certain way of life, interrelated through shared commodities and resources, like Barnabé who is trading bread with his neighbours. Such tribe-scale communities exemplify how a certain way of life can be constructed around a certain materiality. While the notion of the \"tribe\" indeed comes along with notions of autonomy and reducing dependency, they are not bound to be motivated by withdrawal and flight. Instead, while remaining within the framework of an overarching system, they rather represent the Zaptatista's vision of \"a world where many worlds fit\"(QUOTE, Zapatistas).</div>",
